# Android-Controlled-Bluetooth-Robot
Aim of this project is to design and control the motion of robots using the bluetooth
device of an Android phone. The human-machine interaction is moving away from
mouse and pen and is becoming pervasive and much more compatible with the
physical world. With each passing day the gap between machines and humans is being
reduced with the introduction of new technologies to ease the standard of living.
Smartphones have quite changed the traditional ways of human to machine
interaction. Smartphones are now a vital part of a personâ€™s life. Android is a software
platform for mobile devices that includes an operating system, middleware and key
applications. Android application based smartphones are becoming each time more
powerful and equipped with several accessories that are useful for Robots.
Our main objective is to develop an Android app for controlling the robot using
Bluetooth.
This project deals with the design and control of automated vehicle type robots which
can move in desired direction and location. An android application has been
developed using MIT App inventor and a bluetooth communication is made with a
robot which interfaces with a microcontroller to control its direction.
